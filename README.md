<hr/>

If you would like to change which type of image is shown on the Grid Logos variant you can edit line `428` in the `theme_grid.xml`

`<imageType>marquee,cover,titlescreen</imageType>` 

Replace with your choice of: marquee,cover,3dbox,physicalmedia,titlescreen,miximage,fanart,screenshot, or backcover

<hr/>

You can provide your own video or gif background for the Animated scheme

In the `adroit-es-de/files/` folder - remove `background.jpg` and `background.mp4`

Place your own `background.mp4` or `background.gif` inside (if you use an mp4 - take a screenshot of the first frame and place it inside as `background.jpg`)

You can use a `background.mp4` with audio to get background music

You can mute the `background.mp4` audio by changing `<audio>true</audio>` from true to false `theme_grid.xml` line `142` and `theme_list.xml` line `160`

Background music and the game video audio do not play well together - if you want to keep the background music you can disable the game video audio in `theme_list.xml` line `319`
